# Chicago Bikeshare Data
Some data analysis for the Chicago bikes shared data. You can access the IPython notebook in 
[this link](https://www.kaggle.com/diegommarino/comparing-crypto-daily-return).

To correctly execute the python script you need to unzip the csv file (dataset). In addition 
you need to install matplotlib too, using the command ```pip install matplotlib```.

If you are using OS X and running in issues to run the script because of matplotlib, you can 
access [this link](https://matplotlib.org/faq/osx_framework.html) to help you solve the problem.
